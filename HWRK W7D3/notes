       GiphysSearchContainer: Container for our GiphysSearch component.

       GiphysSearch: renders the search bar and handles all of the search logic (keeping track of the query and trigger the AJAX request on submit); renders the GiphysIndex.

       GiphysIndex: iterates over the giphys in props, rendering a GiphysIndexItem for each one.

We want the giphys slice of state to be an array which we will iterate over
