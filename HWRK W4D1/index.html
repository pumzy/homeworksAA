        <h2 id ="directions">How do I go about making cereal</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose which cereal you would like to eat, and grab a bowl. We will be using this bowl to make our cereal</li>
            <li>Fill your bowl 3/4 of the way with the cereal. This is the optimal level.</li>
            <li>Fill the bowl with milk until it is 7/8ths full. It is impotant to ensure that you put in your milk only after the cereal is poured</li>
            <li>Depending on your mood, add some sugar or nutella</li>
            <li>Use a tablespoon to scoop individual mouthfuls of cereal and consume them</li>
          </ol>
